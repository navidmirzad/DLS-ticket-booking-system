# Introduction to our Ticket Booking System - DLS

The DLS Ticket Booking System is a robust, scalable, and secure platform designed to streamline the process of booking tickets for various events. Whether it's concerts, sports, theater, or conferences, our system provides a seamless experience for users to browse, select, and purchase tickets with ease. With a user-friendly interface, secure payment processing, and real-time event management, the system ensures a hassle-free ticketing experience. It leverages a microservices architecture for scalability, queue management for high-traffic events, and data analytics to help administrators optimize ticket sales.

## Technology Stack: MERN + MySQL

The DLS Ticket Booking System is going to be built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack along with MySQL, combining the best of both NoSQL and relational database technologies.

- **MongoDB (NoSQL)** is used for handling event details, notifications, and fast read-heavy operations, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
- **MySQL (RDBMS)** is employed for transactional operations such as ticket bookings and payments, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
- **Express.js & Node.js** power the backend, providing a scalable and high-performance API layer for handling requests efficiently.
- **React.js** drives the frontend, offering a dynamic and responsive user experience for seamless event browsing and ticket booking.

## Project Management Strategy

- **Jira** – Used for project tracking, sprint planning, and task management, ensuring transparency and efficient workflow.
- **Scrum** – Agile methodology with 2-week sprints, daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings to improve team productivity and adaptability.
- **Feature Branching** – Version control strategy using Git where each feature is developed in an isolated branch before merging into the main codebase, ensuring stability and smooth integration.
